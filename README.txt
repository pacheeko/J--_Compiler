Parser for j-- language.

Compile instructions:

Place all files into a directory and type 'make' to compile the program. Flex and Bison will create
many additional files at compile time.

Run instructions:

Type './parser testfile' to run the parser, with testfile being the directory of the file you 
would like to parse. The file 'parse.t23' has been included for testing purposes. Execute the 
command './parser parse.t23' with the parse.t23 file in the same directory as the parser to 
parse through this test example.

** The parser has been compiled and tested on the CPSC linux machines. **
